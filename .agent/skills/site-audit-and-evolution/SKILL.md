# 📈 Site Audit & Evolution

Focuses on the "Why" and "What's Next" of the project, ensuring it stays at the forefront of the luxury real estate market.

## 🔎 Investigation Mechanic

- **Technical Audit**: Run Lighthouse-style checks on performance, SEO, and accessibility.
- **Competitor Mapping**: Research top-tier real estate sites (e.g., Zillow, Sotheby's) to identify missing premium features.
- **Code Debt Analysis**: Identify where vanilla JS may become a bottleneck and suggest React/Next.js migration paths.

## 💡 Suggestion Engine

### 1. Panel Evolution
- **Current**: Decap CMS (Static-file based).
- **Suggestion**: Migration to **CloudCannon** for a "Visual Builder" experience that feels more modern.
- **Suggestion**: Integration of a **Property Management System (PMS)** API to automate property listings.

### 2. UI/UX "Luxury" Upgrades
- **Micro-Interactions**: Suggesting GSAP for scroll-triggered "reveal" animations that feel more fluid than standard CSS.
- **Dark Mode Excellence**: Ensuring the "Luxury Hub" has a high-contrast dark mode that doesn't sacrifice readability.

## 🛠️ Evolution Roadmap

- **Phase A**: Fix current static blockers (Login/Proxy).
- **Phase B**: Enhance current static site with GSAP/Canvas.
- **Phase C**: Transition to a Headless CMS (Sanity) with a Framework (Next.js) for true global scalability.

> [!NOTE]
> Evolution should never break SEO. Always audit `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` during any structural change.
